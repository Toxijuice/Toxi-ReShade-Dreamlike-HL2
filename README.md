# Toxi-ReShade-Dreamlike-HL2

My attempt at making a ReShade shader.

Designed for HL2 but, in theory, should work elsewhere.

If using on a Source Engine game (like intended) make sure that "Copy depth buffer before clear operations" is checked in the D3D9 tab of ReShade. (Available by pressing the HOME key in-game).
